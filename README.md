# Slack-Conversational-Support-Bot-using-RASA

This repository includes a basic FAQ answering support bot developed using the RASA Framework & deployed to slack.

The all in one code is in the notebook named "AI-RASABOT.ipynb". To open this you need to install either the Anaconda Distribution or Jupyter Notebook.

The basic requirements to run this are:
1. Tensorflow (Latest version or 1.10.0)
2. Spacy
3. Rasa Core
4. Rasa NLU
5. Numpy
6. Scikit Learn

Other requirements are mentioned in the notebook itself.

This project follows a guide on https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-conversational-chatbot-for-slack-using-rasa-and-python-part-1-bca5cc75d32f
Since the guide is OUTDATED, its better to follow the guide just for reference.

If you install Anaconda, it will make it easier to run & deploy this bot.

NOTE: TO DEPLOY INSTALL NGROK OR SOME OTHER RESOURCE
